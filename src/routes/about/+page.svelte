            <h4>Interests</h4>
            <p>If you know me, you'll know that I'm extremely easy to get a long with and that my interests (outside of web development) are mostly active.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I love golf, basketball, football, video games, music, video editing, and spending time with my wife, friends and family. I'm also an avid food enjoyer and have been known to throw down in the kitchen from time to time.</p>

            <h4>Journey to Web Development</h4>
            <p>After spending 7+ years in the Real Estate business and becoming recently married in 2022, it became obvious that I needed to change careers.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I began heavy discussions with my wife, best friends, and family about the possibility of switching careers, and it was a unanimous decision that I should switch to coding.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>On April 21st, 2022 with the help of my mom and dad (both retired from tech & engineering) I set up my first HTML document and wrote my first lines of code! From then on, a never ending journey to learn new skills and harness my newfound obsession with web development!</p>
