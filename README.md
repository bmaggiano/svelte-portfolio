## Description

Svelte is a fast growing front-end framework that rivals the intuitiveness and ease of use of React and NextJs. This portfolio was made with the decision to replicate Mint.com's UI/UX experience and I feel like I knocked it out of the park. We use very simple and basic design patterns and color choices to keep the user engaged with different sections, as well as have very similar UI concepts to that of Mint's website. You're able to check out my recent projects, a little about myself, and also a list of a good chunk of my projects. As Svelte grows in popularity, I think it's your duty as a front-end developer to be at least somewhat familiar with how it works.
